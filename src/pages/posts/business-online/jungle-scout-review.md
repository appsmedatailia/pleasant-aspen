## Niche Market Research

 Here is a detailed guide on [How To Do Niche Market Research](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/profitable-niche-market-business/).

*   **Step 1: Niche Market Brainstorming**

*   **Step 2: Niche Audience Brainstorming**

*   **Step 3: Problem and Solution Brainstorming**

*   ** Step 5: Competition Analysis**

We can do the 5 steps of the first milestone via the [***Product Opportunity Finder (Formerly Jungle Scout Niche Hunter)***](https://junglescout.grsm.io/fennex-opportunity-finder)***.***

 

The purpose of niche brainstorming is to identify underserved target audiences. And sell them the product that best meets their needs.

 

Since we operate in the Amazon Selling Business, our target audiences are customers shopping in the Amazon marketplace. It means we can research niches within Amazon categories and subcategories with high demand and low competition directly.

 

### What is the Opportunity Finder?

Opportunity Finder provides countless opportunities that are in high demand and low competition when you plug in specific criteria. See how a keyword performs on the market, emerging trends, and competitive insights when you turn it into a market segment.

By filtering by one or more of the following, you can find product niches to sell in:

*   Average Monthly Units Sold: This is the number of total sales in this niche from month to month.

*   Competition: By using review counts and advertising costs, we identify whether a niche is competitive.

*   Average Monthly Price: This is the average price per listing in the niche.

*   Niche Score: The score is based on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the best opportunity and 1 being the worst. Based on demand, competition, and quality of listings, the score is calculated.

*   Monthly Search Volume: How many times the keyword was searched in the last 30 days.

*   Brand Names: By filtering out top-selling brands, you will view the top private label products.

 

Opportunity Finder includes graphs and charts that show the past performance of a niche.

<h2 id="what-is-a-market">What Is A Market?</h2>

If you do some web research, you can find multiple definitions of that. To keep things simple, we have selected for you a simple definition that relates to our context; doing business online by selling products and services on [Amazon FBA](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/amazon-fba/).

A market is a group of people (customers and potential customers) with the same or similar needs.

For example, all the people who need to be equipped for their next outdoor vacation belong to the Outdoor Market.

Every market has customer members, grouped by segments, who define it. Where a segment is a group of customers (individuals, households, or organizations) who share many characteristics and have the same needs (problems to solve, a lifestyle, or a passion to live).

<h2 id="what-is-a-niche-market">What Is A Niche Market?</h2>

Niche markets are subcategories of large markets. A niche represents one segment of the overall mainstream market on which you will center your efforts. Despite its small size, this segment has unique problems and needs that make it distinct.

For example, outdoor is such a vast market you can’t call it a niche. On the other hand, camping, hiking, climbing, cycling, and fishing are much more defined niche market examples.

Family riverside Camping and Wild mountain camping are even more specific sub-niche market examples of the same Outdoor market. They concern different segments of people and need different equipment.

<h2 id="what-is-niche-market-research">What Is Niche Market Research?</h2>

Niche Market Research is looking for profitable niche ideas with low competition; Then, select profitable products (niche products) that match the needs of the niche segment (the customer).

You want to find the niche needs you can help with, and introduce your niche customers to beneficial solutions that you sell to them via [Amazon FBA](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/amazon-fba/), eCommerce, dropshipping, or affiliate marketing.

<h2 id="why-do-you-need-to-do-niche-market-research">Why Do You Need To Do Niche Market Research?</h2>

Because, if you identify a profitable niche market business, you can address a group of consumers with a similar issue/need that can be solved with a small solution at first.

Also, to generate profits, you must appear on page one of Amazon search results for as many buying keywords as possible. As a result, you need to compete for page one, and to avoid a higher level of competition, target a niche or even a micro niche.

<h2 id="niche-market-typologies">Niche Market Typologies</h2>

Usually when you have a product, you can imagine that it serves a group of people who have similar needs.

These consumers represent a niche audience, and because they share the same needs, all the products that they consume represent niche products.

People who buy products from the health and wellness marketplace do so to improve their mental, physical and spiritual health.

There are several sub-niches in this market, including personal care, nutrition, preventative medicine, and alternative medicine. As they cater to people’s needs, they cater to niche audiences.

You can further refine these niches to target specific audiences, such as fitness enthusiasts, health-conscious families, men with receding hairlines, and nicotine addicts.

These audiences all need niche health-related products. Consequently, each of these niches presents a wide range of product opportunities, including supplements, vitamins, organic foods, ebooks, recipes, hair loss wonder pills, and nicotine patches, among others.

_In niche markets, trending products are a great place to start. However, because trending products come and go, you’ll be more successful if you explore niche audiences and then identify niche products with a market fit._

<h2 id="niche-categories">Niche Categories</h2>

### **Passion Niche**

### **Problem Niche**

<h2 id="the-ideal-niche-market-business">The Ideal Niche Market Business</h2>

Ideally, the niche market you select is already your area of expertise.

*   you know the people.

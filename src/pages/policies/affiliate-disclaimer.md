Hey Guys and Gals.

Guess what? If you click on a link that we have provided, it might be a link to someone who will give us a commission if you buy something from their site, or use their service. That means that we might get paid if you click on that link.

This does not affect the price you pay and, in fact, you often get better pricing or a free trial.

The reason we are telling you all of this is:

1) We want to be upfront and honest with you!

2) It’s illegal not to.

That being said, we promise to use any affiliate commissions for good causes, as a reinvestment back into the site, to bring you even more great content and money-saving strategy.

We will only recommend products we know are of outstanding quality or we use ourselves.

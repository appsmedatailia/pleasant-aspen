<h2 id="what-is-amazon-fba-product-research">What Is Amazon FBA Product Research?</h2>

Amazon FBA product research is all about finding profitable products you can sell in your market.

In the previous blog, we discussed niche markets and the importance of serving a niche audience. In the same context, the goal behind amazon product research is to identify niche products that benefit a niche audience related to a niche market.

Suppose you are in the rock climbing market, sub-niche of the outdoor vertical market; your job is to find niche products that your niche audience, your potential customers, will buy to solve their related niche problems.

<h2 id="why-is-product-research-so-important">Why Is Product Research So Important?</h2>

The first step and the most crucial one that Amazon sellers must take to kick-start their businesses is to find an ideal product or service to sell on Amazon.

The obvious solution might be to browse Amazon bestseller categories, pick a product, slap up a nice logo and custom packaging, and then source it. It might have worked years ago, but Amazon has changed since then, and this strategy is no longer viable. Nowadays, the competition is fierce; As a result, your product likely will end up at the bottom of product page listings.

In other words, you must have an excellent product with a competitive price and strong marketing if you want to succeed on Amazon.

In reality, not surprising that most people who deal with FBA won’t begin until they have low competition, high demand, and private label products.

<h2 id="quality-price-marketing">Quality Price Marketing</h2>

Quality, price, and marketing (photos, packaging, and copywriting) characterize products.

It is essential to balance these three characteristics when conducting product research.

You should, therefore, identify a high-quality product with good marketing and competitive pricing as the ideal product.

Consider:

*   Anyone can lower the price, so you can’t go into a price war! Other sellers will have more money to invest in inventory. They can order more products to reduce production costs. Thus, they can lower the prices and make a profit at the same time.
*   You can’t go into a marketing war. It takes time and money to do great marketing, especially if you are not a good marketer. As an example, supplements and cosmetics require great marketing resources. To enter these markets, you need to invest time and money in professional photography, graphic design and copywriting.
*   You can’t offer poor-quality products! Disappointed customers leave negative reviews, which will cause Amazon to penalize your product.

<h2 id="how-do-you-approach-amazon-product-research">How Do You Approach Amazon Product Research?</h2>

An organized approach to product research is necessary to avoid analysis paralysis. You should develop an effective strategy to save time and stay focused on the most important things.

You must define your working process before you begin your product research. Workflow should comprise several milestones that represent your global progress, where each step in the workflow involves several tasks.

Tasks are micro-actions that you should plan and limit in time so as not to overflow. Having simple actions to perform will also make your work easier and motivate you at the same time.

<h2 id="amazon-seller-product-research-the-ultimate-guide">Amazon Seller Product Research The Ultimate Guide</h2>

The following Amazon FBA product research guide is part of a general workflow on [how to start an Amazon FBA business](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/amazon-fba/). View it here if you didn’t read the article yet.

We assume you have done your [niche market research](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/profitable-niche-market-business/) and found a good niche audience. Doing so will provide you with a starting point for the investigation of niche products.

Our product research process will comprise two millstones ([#2 and #3 from the main FBA workflow)](https://blog.fennex.agency/posts/business-online/amazon-fba/). And the goal is to pre-select about 50 products then analyze them above multiple criteria to filter the top 5 product opportunities.

### **Brainstorm Product Ideas (Milestone #2 of the FBA Biz Workflow)**

The objective is to gather around fifty product ideas and filter them in order to identify potential business opportunities.

#### **Step 1: Set Amazon Product Research Criteria**

The following criteria will help you make an informed decision for your business. So keep them in mind while exploring products.

##### **Price range**

Avoid low-ticket-price products.

Ideally, your target price should be between $25 and $35. Above $50, the cost of inventory may exceed your budget. Below $17, the profit margin may be too low.

##### **Size & Weight**

Avoid oversized and heavy products.

It is critical to target products of standard sizes. Shipping fees may make the product unprofitable if it is heavy and oversized.

##### **Demand**

One component of a successful Amazon product is demand. Are people interested in this product? Would this product address the needs or pain points of the customer?

BSR (Main Category Rank) ranking and keyword monthly search volume are key metrics to determine demand.

##### **Competition**

Evaluate competition to see if any similar products and whether a new entrant can see an opportunity.

Analyze how many products are available on the market and how many reviews and ratings their products have received.

##### **No legal issues**

Is the product patented or restricted? Trademark, licensing, and patents are red flags.

#### **Step 2: Generate Your Product List Idea**

From your niche market, explore Amazon categories and list the products that interest you.

Here are some other ways to come up with a product idea:

*   Amazon’s best-seller list
*   Amazon Basics
*   Checking the section “Customers Also Bought”
*   Exploring the retail stores
*   Browsing about a few products on Pinterest
*   Exploring the Shopify stores
*   Looking at eBay’s trending list
*   Checking AliExpress’s best-sellers list

#### **Step 3: Identify All Criteria**

For each product on the list, identify and collect the maximum related amount of data.

Price, BSR, main keywords (search terms you have used to find the product), monthly search volume, estimated sales, number of reviews, etc.

#### **Step 4: Do 1-week Tracking (optional)**

Use the 999 cart method to check each product’s sales figures and the best seller rank (BSR).

#### **Step 5: Identify Product Opportunities**

In order to select top products that offer good opportunities, you must compare them against the criteria from step one.

### **Identify The Winning Products (Milestone #3 of the FBA Biz Workflow)**

Your goal is to find the Top 5 product opportunities.

#### **Step 6: Find Your Suppliers**

Make sure the product you choose will not cause any problems for you when sourcing it.

##### **\# of suppliers**

Do you know several suppliers on Ali-Express & Alibaba, Alibaba Wholesale, or Alibaba Marketplace? You can negotiate more effectively and make sure you have a backup provider for your product.

##### **Estimated MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) and Item Cost**

Are there suppliers who accept lower initial orders? Set a limit of $1000 to $3500 for your initial investment. In this way, you can verify the potential sales without locking up cash if sales are slow or exposing too much inventory to risk.

##### **Product personalization**

How easy will it be to private label or white label this product? Does the manufacturer allow you to add a brand or have special packaging to set you apart from competitors?

##### **Check Shipping time**

Can suppliers deliver your product within eight weeks? Eliminate products that require long lead times as you want your products delivered to FBA as quickly as possible.

#### **Step 7: Differentiate Your Product**

##### **Look for the product issues to improve.**

Could you improve the product in any way (variations, quality, options)? A few cents more will usually get you better quality. Ask if they have any additional items.

Analyze customer reviews, from the customer questions & answers section, to identify areas for improvement. Does it appeal to customers? What do they dislike? Consider packaging, size, color, function, material, etc.

##### **Look For Bundling Options.**

Can you bundle the product, sold it as multiples, or have bonuses? This way, you make your listing unique so no other seller will jump on it, and you will also add value.

##### **Check Seasonality & Trend**

Make sure there is an upward trend on Google Trends because viable products experience an upward trend over time.

#### **Step 8: Analyze The Competition**

##### **Who dominates the market?**

Are Amazon-owned or national brands dominating the first-page product listings? It is virtually impossible to compete with national brands, avoid competing with heavyweight players.

##### **Marketing level**

On the First 2 or 3 Pages, do you find 8 to 12 poor listings? It shows a chance to do better and position your product easily on the first pages.

Listings with few or low-quality product images, short or not optimized titles, weak bullet points, and limited descriptions are poor listings.

Do the competition’s titles include three to four main keywords? It shows they understand the importance of optimizing listing titles.

##### **Demand level**

Over the last three months, has the price of the top 5 products remained stable? Price stability shows continuous sales.

In the last three months, has the BSR of the top 5 products remained stable? A consistent BSR shows continuous sales.

These are good signs that your market is doing well.

#### **Step 9: Check Estimated ROI (Return On Investment)**

Target at least 100% Profit Margin.

Check that “Item cost + shipping” is less than 30% to 40% of the selling price. It is the 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 rule where 1/3 is the product, 1/3 is advertising, and 1/3 is the margin.

Amazon fees are not over 40% of the cost of your product (due to size or weight). Use the FBA calculator to determine this.

<h2 id="product-categories-to-avoid">Product Categories To Avoid</h2>

*   Private label sellers should not sell complex products like cameras and appliances.
*   Avoid products with complex manufacturing and shipping because of liability, quality assurance, and return issues.
*   Avoid products that go in or on your body, such as food, lotion, cream, or nutritional supplements, as they can create potential risks.
*   Avoid categories such as shoes and clothing. People have preferences for brands, so creating your own might not work.
*   Avoid [restricted categories](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/help/external/G200333160).

<h2 id="why-do-you-need-product-research-tools">Why Do You Need Product Research Tools?</h2>

Manually searching for winning products can quickly become complex and tedious. And you will be limited in the amount of data you can collect to validate and compare your product ideas.

Therefore, automating your search for products with services and apps is extremely useful and will save you time and headaches.

However, if you are new to the process, it would be a good idea to do some manual work to get a better understanding of how selection criteria affect results. It would also provide you with a better understanding of the differences between good and bad products.

### **Product Research Manual Work**

#### **Generate Product Idea**

You can browse products by category and subcategory to find ideas. Amazon’s Best Sellers page is an excellent place to get ideas too.

By looking at a product’s selling information, you can predict which products appeal to your target audience. It can even help you receive a sense of the business you can expand into by checking the related items.

#### **Validate Demand**

To determine if a product is in-demand or not, evaluate the niche and the respective product in the following ways:

*   Google keyword planner
*   Google trends
*   Check the BSRs of similar products.

It’s difficult to determine how often a product sells. The best seller rank well shows how a product is doing within a particular category.

In the same category, an item with a BSR of 20,000 will sell much less than an item with a BSR of 2,000.

If your main category has 3-5 products with BSR ratings of 5000, that means once you reach the top page, you’ll sell a good number of products.

#### **Analyze Competition**

Next, find out what your competitors are doing to sell the product you’ve chosen. Compare their listings quality, ratings, and customer reviews.

Keep in mind that competition is a good thing. It means that your niche market is doing well, and there is an opportunity for sales. However, having a high level of competition can be bad for your business because optimizing your listing for page one takes time and money.

It is a positive sign if at least 3 products on the first page have over 100 reviews. In contrast, having 3 power sellers with over 500 reviews is a red flag.

Tip: If one product has a higher number of reviews than everyone else, you will probably be able to compete for top spots on page one.

### **Product Research Automated Work**

Automating product research saves your time and comes in handy. Think about how long it would take you to search the bestseller lists, check the hot-selling items, analyze product images, descriptions, bullets, listings, and competition.

You need to check whether the product will sell well and whether there will be enough demand. What about the product’s seasonality? Does it only sell well at certain times of the year? Also, you need to check your ROI therefore you have to calculate shipping costs and Amazon fees.

Browse all the products, check out their weight, price, and other criteria; switching between tabs and scrolling listings up and down is time and effort consuming.

Therefore, you need tools that bring everything into one place. A set of tools providing you with an estimate of monthly sales, monthly revenue, how many reviews there are, and a multitude of other useful information to streamline your research.

You can accomplish this in two ways. The first option would be to combine several free tools to collect the data you need. The second option is using paid tools that combine all the features you need into one place.
